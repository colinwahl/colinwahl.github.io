Hi! My name is Colin Wahl.

I'm a software engineer at Awake Security (acquired by Arista Networks).

My professional work currently focuses on the development of elegant and useful user interfaces using [PureScript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript). We use PureScript for all UI development at Awake, and I've been able to help develop/maintain the PureScript ecosystem as a result.

I've had the most fun working on the following projects:
* Being a core contributor to the [PureScript Registry](https://github.com/purescript/registry), helping to get it to alpha and beyond
* Contributing to the PureScript compiler itself (I once [improved Awake's PureScript compile times by almost 50%](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/pull/3768))
* Contributing to [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago), PureScript's build tool. I introduced everybody's least favorite error messages - ask me about it :)

Outside of programming, I enjoy being outdoors (cycling, hiking, or camping), playing video games, and reading. I've tried doing all of those at once, but I wouldn't recommend it.
